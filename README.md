Kutt Out Gallery
===============

This is a gallery system for kutt-out.co.uk. Currently supports uploading, editing and deleting images, one user login and multiple galleries within an updated version of the kutt-out.co.uk design.

To do:
------

* Create a non specific version for any views the user (well, me) wants
* Make the navigation bar dynamically generated.
* Add show/hide support.
* ERROR HANDLING
	* Error handling on db entries - dealing with form validation and returning error codes and such.
	* JavaScript validation - do not hide elements if the server returns an error message rather than a success message.
	* Oh and everywhere else

Kutt Out Gallery
===============

This is a gallery system for kutt-out.co.uk. Currently supports uploading, editing and deleting images, one user login, and all within an updated version of the kutt-out.co.uk design.

To do:
------

* Multiple gallery support
* Create a non specific version for any views the user wants
* Move the notifications into the main content area, or at least make them fade away *nicely*

Kutt Out Gallery
===============

This is a gallery system for kutt-out.co.uk. Currently supports uploading, editing and deleting images, one user login and multiple galleries (including video galleries) within an updated version of the kutt-out.co.uk design.

To do:
------

* GENERAL & SYSTEM FIXES:
	* Error handling on db entries - error codes/exceptions or something
	* Add WAY better handling of the initial setup phase - at the very least when there's no galleries, better when there's no database
	* Add the final two static pages *in progress*
	* Remove all hardcoded /gallery/ links in place of dynamically generated ones, in both PHP, CSS and JS.
	* Add a way to have separators between galleries.
	* Minify & combine CSS and JS files!
	
* TOBYELWES.COM FIXES
	* *Make video galleries work, implement video page view.*
	* Add a logout button.
	* Improve readability of galleries along bar.
	* Add JavaScript to do everything it needs to do.
	* Conversely, stop using shitty JS hacks instead of CSS.

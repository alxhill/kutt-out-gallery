Kutt Out Gallery
===============

This is a gallery system for kutt-out.co.uk. Currently supports uploading, editing and deleting images, one user login and multiple galleries within an updated version of the kutt-out.co.uk design.

To do:
------

* Create a non specific version for any views
* Error handling on db entries - error codes/exceptions or something
* Form validation
* Add WAY better handling of the initial setup phase - at the very least when there's no galleries, better when there's no database
* Add the final two static pages *in progress*
* Make everything sortable. *in progress*
* Remove all hardcoded /gallery/ links in place of dynamically generated ones.

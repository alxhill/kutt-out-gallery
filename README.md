Kutt Out Gallery
===============

This is a gallery system for kutt-out.co.uk. Currently supports uploading, editing and deleting images, one user login and multiple galleries within an updated version of the kutt-out.co.uk design.

To do:
------

* **Add show/hide support.**
* Create a non specific version for any views
* Video/embed link support
* Proper gallery deletion - remove corresponding photos in the gallery as well as the corresponding files
* Switch to using object oriented database query results
* Error handling on db entries - dealing with form validation and returning error codes etc
* Make the galleries in the navigation bar hide when deleted
